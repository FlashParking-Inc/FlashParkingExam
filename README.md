# FlashParkingExam

Things that still need to be done if this were going to live past this weekend. 

* Sort out Entity Framework Core's casing rules and how to define the navigation so all the data objects are cased properly. Probably trivial if you've done it before, but this is my first foray into Entity Framework so I just let it go.
* Get the pages auto-refreshing, probably with a simple JS timer that just repulls the data from the server.
* Seperate out the data access layer from the front end with a service layer
* Unit tests in the event that actual logic ever exists
* Controllers and pages for adding new locations and new parking spaces. 
* Batch data operations such as adding multiple vehicles or removing multiple vehicles at once, or outright transfering the contents of one area to another.
* Logging and error checking.
* Probably other stuff.

Hope you all like it, was a good exercise to learn Entity Framework on and brush up on React with.
